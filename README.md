### Motivation 
The Russian society is divided on the issue of whether to support the war with Ukraine, with even members of the same family holding opposing views. Those who support the war often rely on television as their primary source of information, with its broadcasts playing a significant role in shaping public opinion. This project was undertaken to gain a deeper understanding of the propaganda methods used to sway public opinion effectively.

Using these sources, we developed several hypotheses to investigate whether these techniques are utilized by Russian propaganda:

- Frequent use of catchy slogans that are short, simple, and easy to remember;
- Frequent news stories about the heroes of the “special military operation”4;
- Instilling the idea that Putin is the one and only leader who cannotbe replaced;
- Frequent use of words in relation to Ukrainians that elicit strong negative reactions and fear.

In addition, our objective is to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of propaganda. To achieve this, we compare the monthly time series data of news coverage duration on the topic of Ukraine to the time series data of Russians' attitudes toward Ukraine
